# Reports

Various reports for the multitude of labs I had to endure through.

## Contributing

Don't, unless you somehow enjoy your PR getting dismissed and commented on by a bot. Until GitHub manages to finally add
a setting that lets us disable pull requests, I'm going to use automation.

Perhaps you could make better use of your time and contribute [somewhere else](https://github.com/trending)?

## Building

Assuming you have a proper and working LaTeX installation (Miktex, Latex-Live, whatever):

1. Change into the directory of the report you want to build.
2. `latexmk`
